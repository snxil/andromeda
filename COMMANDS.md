## Commands
Below are some commands that you may use to interact with andromeda! Commands always start with the command prefix chosen in your `config.json`!

- `colour <colour hex>`: View a preview of a colour from a hex code!
- `embed <colour hex> <description>`: Create an embed! If a valid colour is not specified, andromeda will use the colour specified in your `config.json`!
- `emoji`: Create and delete emojis in your guild! Obviously, emoji managing permissions are required!
  - `create <name> <link>`: Create a guild emoji with the specified name and image!

  - Use `help dev` to access command help in the `dev` branch!
- `ping`: Check andromeda's ping and response time!
- `quote <channel name> <message ID>`: Quote a message! Channel names are required for cross-channel quoting, but are not necessary if the message exists in the current channel!
- `setgame <game>`: Set your current "playing" status! Leave blank to reset!

  - Status must be either `online`, `idle`, `dnd` (Do Not Disturb), or `invisible`!
- `time`: Show people your system time!

## Tags
Andromeda has a simple tag system that allows you to quickly and easily paste text, as well as list and manage your tags! Tags and tag commands always start with the tag prefix chosen in your `config.json`!
- `(tag)`: Use a tag!
- `create <name> <content>`: Create a new tag!
- `delete <name>`: Delete a tag!
- `update <name> <content>`: Update an existing tag with new content!
- `info <name>`: Get some info on a tag!

I'm always working on more features to make andromeda the best it can be, and I'm definitely always welcome to suggestions if there's something you really want to see!
